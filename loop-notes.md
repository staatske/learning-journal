# Reading 8 - Loops

Comparison operators | Definitions
---------------------| -----------
```==``` | is equals to, this one will match 'true' in boolean or string
```!=``` | is not equals to
```===``` | scrict equals to. 'true' in boolean would not equal it in a string
```!==``` | strict not equals to
```>``` | greater than
```>=``` | greater than or equals to
```&&``` | logical and...compares two sides of an equation ... for example (5>2) && (3>2) would register as true....if either side were false it would return false
```||``` | logical or....if either side is true it'll return true
```!``` | inverts the return...if it shows true it'll return false 

### IF STATEMENT

If statements will evaluate a condition and if true the subsequent code block is executed

### LOOPS

Loops check a condition and if true a code block will run, then the code block will run again until false.

- initialization - create a variable and set it to 0
    - ``` var i = 0 ```
- condition - the loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number
    - ``` i < 10; ```
- update-  every time the loop has run the statements in the curly brackets, it adds one to the counter
    - ```i++```

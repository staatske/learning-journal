## Text editor

What is a **text editor**?
- A text editor is a program that lets you write an manage code.
- There are many different text editors depending on a developer's different preferences.

How do text editors **vary**? 
- *code* completion is when the text editor auto completes the code that you began
- *syntax* highlights makes it visually easier to digest the code you have written or are working on
- *themes/colors* can be important depending on your personal preference and can reduce eye strain
- *extensions* can make it easier to automate some repititive tasks and make your job easier

What are some **popular** text editors?
- Text edit (Mac) and Notepad (Windows) are default options available on these two popular computer models
- Other 3rd party options include [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Text Wrangler](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395?mt=12), [BB Edit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text, which have more dynamic functionality.

## Terminal

What is a **terminal**?
A terminal is a text based interface on a computer system that quickly helps you navigate, without the graphic user interface. You can enter commands via text, and feedback will be delivered back via text. 

What is it **used for**?
For right now, we are only using this to find files.

Some **important commands**:
- pwd - Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently. - if you don't know where you're at
- ls - List the contents of a directory. - this will show you what else is in the folder
- cd - Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
- ~ = takes you to the home
- . = current directory
- .. = moves you up the hierarchy
- help = will give you a list of commands
- touch - create files
- mkdire - creates a directory

# Day 4 Notes - HTML

## PROCESS AND DESIGN

#### Your audience

When designing a webiste...think of ***who*** you are building the website for. Some considerations:
- Age
- Gender
- Income
- Education
- Occupation
- Size of company

It also helps to make a fictional visitor, which we call a ***persona***. This helps make it more personal when you are thinking of your ideal visitor.

#### Your niche

After you've thought through your audience at a personal level, begin to think through ***why*** they would come to your website:
- Are they looking to learn something?
- Do you want to entertain them?
- Do you want to provide a tool that is useful to them?
- Do you want to let them interact with other people?

#### Site map & wireframe

Once you've outlined what you want your site to cover, then you should think through how it is organized. A help way to do this is called card mapping, where you summarize the cards and figure out an intuitive display and map.

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information and how it is display in the space of the screen (desktop, mobile, etc). This sketch can be done on a whiteboard or a piece of paper, and should just be basic graphics and text, not the actual content or final design.

#### Design

Once you've built out the wireframes, then you are ready for design. Design helps organize and prioritize the messages and attention of your users, and guides them to where you want them to go.

An important element of design is balance. Webpages can become very busy very quickly with images, colors, font size, articles, links, etc. It is important to give space so the page doesn't get too busy.

## STRUCTURE

Notes:
- for HTML code, the commands in the <> are called **elements** for example ```<body>``` the **element** will contain everything between the opening and closing tags denoted with a backslash
- these elements usually have an **opening and closing tag** - for example ```<body>``` above would be closed with ```</body>```
- when writing in HTML you need to start everything with ```<html>``` and ```</html>```
- ```<body>``` tag will indicate anything between that and the closing tag will display in the browser window
- ```<h1>``` shows the header and header level
- ```<head>``` goes above body and whos the title of the page

## HTML5

Tags: 
- ```<p>``` paragraph this is what you put text in 
- ```<footer>``` footer section 
- ```<article>``` 
- ```<main>```
- ```<br>``` - line break

# Day 6 - Javascript intro

We followed instructions to implement Javascript onto a website to begin to get a feel for how it works. See below and a few learnings.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Constructive &amp; Co.</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/c01.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Constructive &amp; Co.</h1>
        <script>document.write('<h3>Welcome!</h3>');
        </script>
        <p>For all orders and inquiries please call
            <em>555-3344</em></p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Learnings:
- This code is a bit more dynamic. The functionality is that it will display a different greeting based on the time of day.
- Javascript adds in interactivity to the site
- I'm curious what clock this one line of Javascript is using
- It looks like it follows if/then logic, and you need a default if all else fails (ie you have a computer with no clock, etc)

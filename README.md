### What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset is...
- knowing that you can learn **anything**
- **overcoming** moments of doubt, and becoming positive 
- that everyone needs to **start somewhere** in order to learn any subject or skill
- encouraging others to also succeed on their journey of learning

Three things I always need to remind myself so I can try to keep a growth mindset:
1. Starting is the hardest. Take the first step!
1. Everyone was a novice at one point.
1. Even the best at the craft find things that trip them up...it's how you react and overcome those obstacles that matters.

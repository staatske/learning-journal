# Day 1 - Growth Mindset and Markdown

### What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset is...
+ Believing that with **effort** and persistence that you can learn
+ That talent is **not** the most important variable
+ That **"yes you can"** learn this
+ That IQ is not a fixed metric, it **grows** as you continue to grow

Three things I always need to remind myself so I can try to keep a growth mindset:
1. Starting is the hardest. Take the first step!
1. Everyone was a novice at one point.
1. Even the best at the craft find things that trip them up...it's how you react and overcome those obstacles that matters.
